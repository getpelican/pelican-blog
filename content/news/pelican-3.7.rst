Upgrading from previous releases
================================

Unlike Atom, the RSS feed specification does not contain a ``<content>``
field and only contains a ``<summary>`` field. Pelican previously put
the full content in this field, which could cause odd behavior in feed
readers that only expected a summary. For this reason, RSS feeds in
Pelican 3.7 will by default only contain article summaries. To revert to
the previous full-content behavior, either use Atom (which supports both
``<summary>`` and ``<content>`` fields) or set:
``RSS_FEED_SUMMARY_ONLY = False``

If you have defined ``MD_EXTENSIONS`` in your settings file, you will
see deprecation warnings since that setting has been replaced by the
``MARKDOWN`` setting in Pelican 3.7. Refer to the corresponding entry in
the `Settings <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.7.0/settings.html>`__
documentation to see the new default value and replace any existing
``MD_EXTENSIONS`` settings with your preferred customized variation of
the ``MARKDOWN`` setting.

Themes originally had access to two identical context variables:
``PAGES`` and ``pages``. This redundancy was removed in Pelican 3.7, so
any themes that use ``PAGES`` will need to be updated to use ``pages``
instead.

``JINJA_EXTENSIONS`` has been replaced by the ``JINJA_ENVIRONMENT``
setting. Any plugins that refer to the former setting will need to be
updated. Refer to the corresponding entry in the
`Settings <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.7.0/settings.html>`__
documentation for more information.

As always, we do everything we can to maximize backwards compatibility
and ensure smooth Pelican upgrades. If you run into problems, please see
the `How to Get
Help <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/contribute.html#how-to-get-help>`__
section of the documentation, and we will update this post with any
upgrade tips contributed by the Pelican community.
