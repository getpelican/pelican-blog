Pelican now has a blog of its own!

:date: 2012-07-23

Since Alexis started working on this almost two years ago, a bunch of happy
hackers joined the effort to make pelican a better tool, again and again, so I
thought having a project blog would be a good idea.

We'll try to keep you updated with the latest evolutions of pelican here.
We have a 3.0 version coming with *a lot* of niceties in there which will
hopefully be ready by the end of the week. Kyle is working on py3k support for
integration after 3.0, we'll also get rid of some stuff that doesn't make sense.
